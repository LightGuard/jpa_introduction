/**
 * Converts {@link LocalDate} to {@link java.sql.Date} and back
 * in support of JPA persistence.
 * <p>
 * The existence of this class in the classpath and it being known by the persistence unit
 * is sufficient
 * to allow you to use the as-of Java SE 8 {@link LocalDate} class in
 * an {@link javax.persistence.Entity} or in other persistable classes.
 * <p>
 * Important: the setting of <code>@Converter(autoApply = true)</code>
 * in this class will make this conversion
 * effective for all Entities that have one or more
 * persistent {@link java.time.LocalDate} properties.
 * <p>
 * The persistence provider must minimally support
 * <a href="https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr338/index.html">JPA 2.1</a>
 * for this to work.
